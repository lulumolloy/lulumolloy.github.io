<h1>Dear Andy</h1>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>Brady and I are in America now. Safe. Life is so different here, I try to compare to back home, but it&rsquo;s apples to oranges. We&rsquo;re in New York City, twenty of our cities could fit here, probably more. And oh god, there&rsquo;s so many people. Remember when we were all brought to the old football stadium after the bombings? (I guess soccer stadium now that I&rsquo;m American) Anyhow it&rsquo;s like that except every day. No holiday or special occasion but the streets are packed with so many different people. Before we came, I was worried that Brady and I would stand out, but that isn&rsquo;t the case, everyone is so varied, plus with all the people you&rsquo;d hardly notice two foreigners.</p>
<p>Brady likes the city more than I do. He came back from the market yesterday with five different chocolates in his hands, and that didn&rsquo;t even cover half of the selection it had. You would&rsquo;ve loved it Andy, we&rsquo;re spoiled for choices. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about it, it&rsquo;s so unfamiliar, big, and loud. There are so many people, yet I&rsquo;ve never felt so isolated. I miss home. I&rsquo;m tired of things feeling new, of trying to figure out what&rsquo;s expected of me, of what I&rsquo;m supposed to do. I feel like a little kid again. Brady feels like the only connection I have to our home, but even he&rsquo;s fading. He doesn&rsquo;t talk much about it; he&rsquo;s fully immersing himself into this new life. I don&rsquo;t know whether to be jealous he&rsquo;s adapting so quickly or to be happy for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few months. I can&rsquo;t say a ton has changed, though Brady has a fulltime job now. He&rsquo;s bartending. I tried, but after I majorly panicked from the sound of a glass breaking, I got fired. I don&rsquo;t want to go into it, but if I were the owner, I would&rsquo;ve fired me too. Amelia said it&rsquo;s PTSD. Brady said that only happens to soldiers, that what we went through sucked, but we have to move on. I want to move on, but his version of moving on is different than mine, he wants to completely ignore everything, forget the past and become a different person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s doing well in this new life. Me? Not so much. Maybe there&rsquo;s some credence to his strategy. He&rsquo;s still laughing, cracking jokes, and making friends with everyone, everything on the outside screams &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing great.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s probably not completely true, just a mask that he&rsquo;s forcing into reality. Honestly, the more time passes, the more I think it&rsquo;s working. He&rsquo;s not the Brady we knew anymore. I&rsquo;m not the Trevor you knew either, I&rsquo;m a lot more withdrawn and quiet, but after everything how can we not change?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being pressured to make choices about my life, I&rsquo;m twenty after all, I have to get my life in order. It feels like too much. Part of me wants to be back home with you. Do you remember the life plans we made when we were kids? How Brady and I were going to get business degrees and you&rsquo;d go to culinary school. We were gonna open a caf&eacute;, Caf&eacute; TBA, with the best baked goods in town. Wake up every morning to the smell of fresh bread and muffins. Open the doors to neighborhood, a little chime on the door ringing with every new friend coming inside. Brady would man the counter, I&rsquo;d make the coffees and you&rsquo;d come out from the back, covered in flour, scolding us for something or other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>I read a news article yesterday about home, it looks like we all left at a good time, things are looking worse. I can&rsquo;t help but think about our other friends, our classmates, the aunties at the market that gave us free fruit, how are they all doing? I&rsquo;ve stopped caring about the computer I had to leave behind, or the signed trading cards we sold, all I want is to see all those people again. Even if it was just one more time. I want to know they&rsquo;re okay. Even grouchy Mr. Miller who confiscated our wayward balls and frisbees. Is he still taking every toy that lands in his yard? Does he even still have a yard?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to connect to people here, but it&rsquo;s hard. Brady&rsquo;s managing to do it, easily, no surprise there. He&rsquo;s got a whole new friend circle. I can&rsquo;t help but feel bitter, like he&rsquo;s leaving us behind. He&rsquo;s still in my life at least, I doubt he&rsquo;s written to you at all. This is all so unfair, I know I sound like a child saying that, but it is. Our entire world was taken away and half a year later he&rsquo;s acting as though he&rsquo;s lived in America his whole life. These new friends are his only friends and I just happen to be that bummer roommate that can&rsquo;t stop talking about the war. Would you be like that if you were here? I know you wouldn&rsquo;t, you valued people as much as I do. I&rsquo;m starting to cry again. I really wish you were here Andy.</p>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>I got a scholarship to a college. I&rsquo;ve been living in the dorms for two weeks now. Brady is still in New York, he&rsquo;s enrolled in a college too. I considered staying with him, but I figured it would be for the best to separate a bit. We occasionally talk on the phone, though that&rsquo;s been getting less and less frequent. He&rsquo;s better without me, I was a mopey strain on his life, bringing down the entire mood. Besides, Amelia wanted to move in with him, so it was perfect timing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a free counseling center here, I&rsquo;ve been going a lot, it helps. They&rsquo;ll never understand everything of course, but just being able to talk helps a bit. I&rsquo;ve joined a movie club and have been working to make some friends, put myself out there a bit more. Life is slowly looking up, I&rsquo;m starting to have some cautious hope. I hope the nightmares will stop soon, I don&rsquo;t want to annoy my roommates because of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, life got really hectic once finals week hit and I had to start the job hunt. I landed a good one, the pay is decent and there&rsquo;s chances to move up. You&rsquo;d never guess but I&rsquo;m officially an accountant, boring right? I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate boring, it&rsquo;s safe, cozy. I&rsquo;ve really turned into one of the old men we&rsquo;d make fun of as kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brady&rsquo;s wedding got pushed up, Amelia got pregnant, so it has to happen before the baby bump keeps her out of her dress. I&rsquo;m struggling to feel happy for them. Besides the pregnancy causing a change to wedding plans their lives are so enviable. Brady&rsquo;s got a fantastic job at some law firm, a ton of super close friends, a nice house. He isn&rsquo;t lugging around the trauma of the war like I am. He doesn&rsquo;t have to go to therapy once a week (more if it&rsquo;s a bad week). He doesn&rsquo;t have to visit a psychiatrist and bounce around with medicines until he can get stabilized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s stupid to think like that, I should be happy for him, glad that his life is going so well but I&rsquo;m just not. I selfishly want the old Brady back, the Brady from before we came here, before the war, before life went to hell. I want my friends back. I want my family back. I&rsquo;m just a selfish child who can&rsquo;t move on, who can&rsquo;t be grateful and happy for what I&rsquo;m given. If you were here maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, I&rsquo;d have one person in my court, though probably not.</p>
<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>I just got back from the funeral. The kids were there, saying goodbye to their father. It brought back so many memories, horrible memories mostly. I feel broken. Brady and I hadn&rsquo;t talked in nearly a year and out of nowhere he calls me up, tells me how much he loves me. I should&rsquo;ve done something, maybe I could&rsquo;ve stopped this. My therapist tells me that it&rsquo;s not my fault, I wasn&rsquo;t part of his life, I couldn&rsquo;t have known. That suicide has a million factors, Brady didn&rsquo;t die because of me. No one has ever died because of me. I can&rsquo;t control bullets, can&rsquo;t control life and death. Part of me feels helpless, now two of my friends have died and there was nothing I could do to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that I&rsquo;ve been resentful of Brady for so long, for this perfect life I thought he had. Amelia told me that he had nightmares like I do, that she&rsquo;d urged him to go to therapy. He pushed away all of his negative emotions, the fear, the trauma, the heartbreak of the past, trying to forget it all happened, but it bubbled over. He&rsquo;s not an official casualty of the war, but he might as well be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I swear to myself, and to you, and to Brady that I&rsquo;m going to live a good life, we can&rsquo;t all get destroyed by that stupid godforsaken war. I&rsquo;m going to learn how to cope with my trauma and learn how to have a happy life. I can&rsquo;t promise an exciting or thrilling life, I&rsquo;ve had too much of that already, but I&rsquo;d like a happy life, a safe life, filled with family and friends. If not for myself, then for you guys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Andy (and Brady),</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anniversary, twenty years now since we parted Andy, and nearly ten since Brady passed. As promised, I&rsquo;m doing well, more or less. I still have occasional nightmares, or jerk at the sound of fireworks, but life is getting better day by day. I have my own little family, my wife just gave birth to a daughter, Andrea. She disapproved of the name Brandy. We live about five minutes from Amelia and the kids, I see them all the time. I&rsquo;ll catch myself tearing up occasionally, seeing their happy faces as they run around reminds me of us, how we used to be. I&rsquo;m going to do everything I can to make sure these kids don&rsquo;t have to go through anything like we did, that they can be happy, and they don&rsquo;t have to struggle like us. I love you both so much, you were are my best friends, my life wouldn&rsquo;t be half a good as it is without you, good times and bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love Trevor</p>
