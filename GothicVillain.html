<h1>Context</h1>
<p>In this work I examined the relationship and attitudes that Frankenstein had towards his own creation and the resulting insanity from this venture. The attitudes of the times were consider when analyzing the text, as well as current thoughts and beliefs. Frankenstein is a complex character, akin to anti hero in some ways, a concept which was truly taking off in gothic stories. By using several different lenses to understand Frankenstein I can to the conclusion that he&rsquo;s closer to a villain than to an anti-hero, yet he acts as our protagonist, which is fascinating.</p>

<h1>The Gothic Villain as a Protagonist</h1>
<p class="start"><i>Originally created February 2024 for ENGL 410: 18th Century Literature (Gothic Literature)</i></p>
<p>The point of view characters, or protagonists in stories are most often the good guys, the heroes. Gothic writers popularized the protagonists being anti-heroes, a morally gray hero, however they were still undeniably heroes at the end of the story. So, what happens when a gothic author places their villain in the protagonist role instead, who believe himself to be a hero, and in some senses starts off as a hero? Mary Shelly does this in her novel Frankenstein, in which the story is told from Dr. Frankenstein&rsquo;s point of view. Frankenstein, starts the story as a hero before quickly spiraling into the archetypal gothic villain, consumed by madness and greed.</p>
<p>Frankenstein starts his journey as a heroic figure, with his passion for scientific discovery driving him towards his goals, and his eventual project. He tells us that during his initial studies he was &ldquo;...engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries&rdquo; (ch. 3). By illustrating his zeal in this way, his heart and soul, it gives a sense of purity to his drive. Following our hearts has long since been a staple of romanticism, with archetypal heroes often having that as a driving factor in their acts of good. Scientific discovery is also a force for good, at least on first instinct, with new inventions capable improving life, and even saving it. Frankenstein aimed to be this sort of hero, the scientist that would change the world for the better.</p>
<p>His heroic characteristics continue with his outlook on the natural world, specifically the way he appreciates the sublime majesty of life and death. On recounting his initial research he explains that he &ldquo;...saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; [He] beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; [He] saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain&rdquo; (ch. 3). Every part of this description evokes poetry. He isn&rsquo;t viewing this process through a clinical lens, but instead his entire soul is dedicated to it, basking in the light. Having this appreciation is a staple of gothic heroes, who similarly remark on sublime aspects of the natural world, further framing Frankenstein as a poetic hero.</p>
<p>Heroes of course need a villain to fight, and Frankenstein&rsquo;s chosen villain starts him down the spiral of madness, with a goal to defeat Death. He stops viewing the natural order as inherent, as a thing to behold, and instead sees death as &ldquo;devot[ing] the body to corruption&rdquo; (ch. 3). As a self styled hero, it&rsquo;s his job to stop corruption, save people, so therefore he must fight against death. This idea is ridiculous, life and death are natural forces that cannot be stopped, and despite his seeming understanding in this previously, he pivots away from rationality. He looses the grounding of the sublime and is plunged into madness, into an impossible fight against the forces of nature, against Death itself.</p>
<p>His original passion for his project is warped into obsession, his heart and soul aren&rsquo;t just engaged, but consumed by it. Passion and obsession are a fine line, with the key difference being that the obsession will overtake your life, it becomes the only thing that matters. Frankenstein himself states that everything else falls to the wayside during this time, and he went as far as &ldquo;depriv[ing] [him]self of rest and health&rdquo; (ch. 4). Gothic villains are often driven by similar obsession, sacrificing people, things, anything and everything they can to achieve their goals. In the example of Frankenstein he isolates himself from society, loosing all contact with the outside world. He also bypasses the morals of his society, breaking the laws to steal corpses from the cemetery, disturbing the enteral slumber of others all for his own goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankenstein has an aura of confidence and arrogance in his goal to usurp death that would make God blush. He doesn&rsquo;t think stop to wonder if this goal is even possible, instead he plows straight through. According to him, &ldquo;life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through&rdquo; (ch. 3). Phrasing it like that makes it seem like upturning the natural order was easy as breaking down a wall, and he would do exactly that. There&rsquo;s no doubt or contemplation of the feasibility of his goal on Frankenstein&rsquo;s mind. While confidence is a good thing, too much confidence, arrogance, isn&rsquo;t good; It can blind you from issues and problems, preventing you from gaining that success. Goals need to be obtained with a clear head, with a readiness and willingness to solve problems and adjust the route you&rsquo;re headed down. Frankenstein doesn&rsquo;t do this; He&rsquo;s arrogant and foolhardy in his plan, never considering how it could go wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, he started to seem himself as a new God, able to wield power over life and death itself. He states that he would bring about a new species, which &ldquo;would bless [him] as its creator and source&rdquo; (ch. 3). These are the words of someone ready to embark on the ultimate power trip, positioning himself in the ultimate spot. He doesn&rsquo;t use the word God, but everything in his statement alludes to this. Like god, he would be a creator, creating life. The word bless also makes the reader think about religion, further clarifying and cementing the idea of godhood present in Frankenstein&rsquo;s head. Gothic villains are power hungry, oftentimes striving for wealth and land to get this power, but he brings this to another level, wanting all the power, in order to be God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankenstein cements his fate as a gothic villain with his reaction to his &lsquo;success.&rsquo; He describes feeling as though the &ldquo;beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled [his] heart&rdquo; (ch. 4). The fantasy was broken. This is the moment where it dawns on him what exactly he had done, the crimes against nature he had committed, and he&rsquo;s disgusted by it. Disgust is an especially profound word, conveying the emotion felt when viewing disturbing, obscene and/or offensive things. Using this words clues the audience into his realization. He&rsquo;s not upset just because the Monster is ugly, but because it&rsquo;s an affront to everything good. On top of that, it&rsquo;s evidence of his own spiral towards evil. As such, he regards it with disdain and horror.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with Frankenstein&rsquo;s morality in this moment is his lack of accountability for his actions. He probably feels guilt about what he&rsquo;s done, but instead of reflecting on that, he shifts the blame to the Monster, even stating that it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;overthrow&rdquo; (ch. 4). Overthrow directly ties back to his god complex, you need power in order to be overthrown in the first place. Frankenstein frames the Monster as the overthrower, the villain of his story, making the Monster the one who did wrong. This even extends to him calling the Monster a monster, not allowing the audience another name to identify the creature as. Names are powerful things, and can taint the perspective of the audience. Ultimately what Frankenstein is doing is projecting his faults and his crimes on to the Monster, creating it into a proper monster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every sentence onward is used to paint the Monster as a monstrous creature, creating a very skewed perspective, one which Frankenstein may have fooled himself into believing. After running from his creation, shortly after its birth, the Monster comes into his room. We&rsquo;re told that &ldquo;...his [Monster&rsquo;s] jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me&rdquo; (ch. 4). In this short scene, the Monster doesn&rsquo;t do anything to Frankenstein, it doesn&rsquo;t even try to do anything. All we&rsquo;re shown is the Monster smiling and reaching out. This could easily be describing a toddler coming into their parents room at night, wanted to interact, but Frankenstein doesn&rsquo;t paint it that way. Instead he milks every bit of malice and drama he possibly can out of a benign action, creating a scenario where the Monster was just shy of snatching him, with him running away just in time. Even using the word jaws dehumanizes the Monster, further adding to the warped perspective.</p>
<p>This scene of the monster coming to him at night, also illustrates the self-centered-ness of Frankenstein, another hallmark of a gothic villain. He&rsquo;s given birth to new life, and immediately abandons it, focused solely on the fear of being hurt. He doesn&rsquo;t stop to consider that the Monster may not be dangerous. When that new life comes to him, reaching out, trying to speak, he runs again. Throughout the book Frankenstein keeps running, never listening to the Monster, never giving him a chance. He&rsquo;s solely concerned for himself. This selfishness is seen before the Monster is born too; During his studies he ignored his family, and others who cared about him. In a lot of ways he&rsquo;s like an absentee father, running from responsibility, letting his child suffer because he can&rsquo;t own up to what he&rsquo;s done, and refuses to fix it. He doesn&rsquo;t want to stretch himself and make the situation better for the both of them. He doesn&rsquo;t even view the monster as another person, he decides that it&rsquo;s a Monster, and that&rsquo;s that, nothing will change his mind. It&rsquo;s a perfect excuse to be selfish isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Frankenstein started this journey as a hero, with passion and good morals, and quickly plunged into madness. This essay only covers a small section of his story, focusing on the turning point of Frankenstein&rsquo;s life, the moment he turned from hero to villain. Frankenstein never redeems himself, in fact he only dives deeper into his new role. Part of the reason this story has stayed popular, seeing countless spinoffs, re-tellings, and re-imaginings, is partly because of it&rsquo;s protagonist. Shelley toyed with audience expectations, choosing to focus not on the hero, but instead the villain; This story doesn&rsquo;t even have a clear hero. Having the villain at the center stage provided a new outlook, a thrilling new way to characterize the icon of the gothic story, and while doing that, helped to create the science fiction genre that we know and love today.</p>
