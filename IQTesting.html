<h1>Racial Prejudice in Intelligence Testing</h1>
<p>Intelligence testing is widely used throughout America, most often in schools. However, while it may be prevalent, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that these tests are useful, in fact in many cases tests can be detrimental. Along with the extensive history of intelligence testing, America also has an extensive history of segregating, discriminating, and denying opportunities to minorities, especially black people. While people today are striving to be more accepting, the long-term effects of &ldquo;&hellip;the pervasive discrimination against Black and other minority groups&hellip; [include] widespread poverty, ill-health, fear, and poor education...&rdquo; (Branch, et. al, 1995, pg 100) which can all lead to lower IQ scores than white Americans. Not to mention the faulty research, and racist foundations, modern intelligence testing is based on. This essay will dive deeper into the causes of this racial divide in intelligence scores, as well as the effects this can have on black students (Branch, et. al, 1995)</p>
<p>Throughout history, people have wanted to measure intelligence scientifically. Current intelligence tests, also referred to as intelligence quotient (IQ) testing, began in the early 1900s with the Binet-Simon scale. This test was focused on identifying mentally handicapped students in France and is considered the first reliable test. This test later made its way to America, in part thanks to Henry Godard who translated the test, leading to its massive success overseas. Despite this &ldquo;Binet kept working to refine the definition of intelligence&hellip; He sought a more sophisticated understanding of mental capacity&rdquo; (Glaser, 1993, pg 6). Binet, like many modern psychologists, didn&rsquo;t believe that intelligence could be quantified in a single number, because intelligence has many different facets. Robert J. Sternberg explains that these tests measure &ldquo;&hellip;a narrow construct. And the results are taken as if it tells you everything you need to know about intelligence&rdquo; (as cited in Glaser, 1993, pg 4). These tests are well known to be unreliable, giving no attention to the many types of intelligence that can lead to a person being a valuable member of society. It has been proven again and again that someone can be successful with low scores, and unsuccessful with high scores. (Glaser, 1993)</p>
<p>The issues with IQ tests do not end with a narrow scope of intelligence, in fact, the most common and devastating issue is the cultural bias these tests have, intentional or not. Since the beginning of its widespread use, there has been a pattern of minorities scoring lower on the tests, with black people consistently scoring ten to fifteen points lower than white people. While America is very diverse, minorities are still somewhat segregated, creating unique experiences for those in that group. While many test makers as striving to avoid this cultural bias, it still exists, with the generic test taker being seen as white and middle class. You may ask yourself; how can this cultural contrast make such a big difference? A political cartoon illustrated it by having an African chief speak to a white scholar. He says &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t build a hut&hellip;you know nothing about predicting the weather &ndash;you do terribly on our IQ test&rdquo; (Glaser, 1993, pg 5). The scholar, while clearly smart, is seen as anything but in this strange new environment. This example is extreme, of course, but it serves to highlight the point of how much of an effect these differences can have (Glaser, 1993).</p>
<p>The issue of minorities scoring lower on IQ tests were often exploited as a way to get those &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; people out of the gene pool, in a practice known as eugenics. An early pioneer in intelligence differences between the races, Francis Galton, was also a famed eugenicist, a term which he originally coined. He believed that these differences in test scores were not due to any issues with the tests, but that minorities, specifically blacks, were mentally inferior. His research methods were based on the idea that physical attributes, reaction times as well as the persons status in life were &ldquo;overt manifestations of intellectual abilities that were amenable to scientific study&rdquo; (Helms, 2012 pg. 176-7). This means that he thought these attributes could be accurately measured to come to a solid conclusion of a person&rsquo;s level of intelligence. This thinking fails to account for systematic racism that leads to minorities being denied many of the advantages and opportunities, such as better education, that would lead to higher IQ scores (Helms, 2012).</p>
<p>Galton had a huge influence on early intelligence research, especially his beliefs on the racial superiority of whites. One scientist affected by his thoughts, Lewis Terman, theorized &ldquo;blacks were incapable of abstract reasoning,&rdquo; (Helms, 2012 pg. 177). An especially destructive force using Galton&rsquo;s ideas was Henry H. Godard. Goddard altered the Binet-Simon test, coining it the Goddard-Binet examination. Goddard claimed that &ldquo;intelligence testing demonstrated that poverty and crime were caused by feebleminded persons&rdquo; (Ryan, 2007 pg. 256). He would test the intelligence of delinquent children, many of whom were poor white-passing minorities. Even when the test scores were relatively normal for the child&rsquo;s age, they were still diagnosed as possible feebleminded and retested until Goddard got the low score he wanted. Once the low score was obtained, they were taken from society, kept reproducing, which was humane compared to the forced sterilization measures others were taking at the time (Ryan, 2007).</p>
<p>This deep history of intelligence tests being used, and often manipulated, to discriminate against minorities has led to very flawed tests that are still being used today. It is estimated that over three quarters of schools are still using intelligence testing around three times during a child&rsquo;s schooling. While this testing may help to identify children with special needs Kevin P. Dwyer argues that this can also be done by observing the child. He explains &ldquo;&hellip;how often people will take the test, and all they want is the IQ number, and they don&rsquo;t care how the kid got there&rdquo; (as cited in Glaser, 1993 pg. 4). Missing a special needs child just because they&rsquo;re able to score normally can be detrimental to their future success. IQ tests are also used to put children on gifted tracks, continuing the pattern of minorities being excluded from opportunities.</p>
<p>Intelligence testing scores, while still used widely in schools, aren&rsquo;t given the same reverence they once had, in part due to the sorted past of these tests. While getting rid of these tests all together is very unlikely, understanding and acknowledging the many reasons why some people may score lower than others, specifically black Americans, can help to develop better, more reliable tests for identifying learning disabled children. Knowing the past of intelligence testing is also a stark reminder that relying too heavily on a single test, as well as relying on faulty research, can lead to horrific outcomes. Outcomes that can lead someone to think that the amount of melanin in a person&rsquo;s skin has anything to do with how smart they are.</p>
