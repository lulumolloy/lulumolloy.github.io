    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p> This poster explains a grammar rule of English, one that probably only needs to be taught to non-native speakers. Given that adjective order isn&rsquo;t vital to communication (in English) I targeted it towards more advanced learners, but left room for younger ones to also enjoy. I chose a comic book-esque theme to appeal to the audience and draw in their attention. I used simple words and made the concept as easy to grasp as possible while maintaining accuracy.</p>

    <p>This project was completed in two steps, the first being an essay researching into the topic, and the second part was creating an infographic based on the earlier information. During this process I created a poll for people to complete to  better support my analysis of the topic, and from this was able to extrapolate some extra information that the previous research didn&rsquo;t have. Specifically about real use cases. There were many steps and plans that had to be put into palace to successfully complete this large scale project.</p>
