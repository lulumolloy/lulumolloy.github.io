    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p> This poster explains a grammar rule of English which only needs to be taught to non-native speakers. Given that adjective order isn&rsquo;t vital to clear communication (in English) I targeted the poster towards more advanced learners, while leaving room for younger ones. I chose a comic book-esque theme to appeal to the audience and draw attention. I used simple words to make the concept easier to grasp.</p>

    <p>This project was done in two steps: First an essay researching the topic, and secondly the creating of an infographic based on the previous work. During the process I created a poll to  better support my analysis, and was able to extrapolate extra information that previous research didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
