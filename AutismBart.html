<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Autism was not recognized when this story was created, however it has always existed. In current times, with my vast knowledge of autism, I saw a man who fit into the spectrum. Utilizing current understanding and the understanding of people of the time, I crafted an understanding of the text through this idea of neurodiversity. I also focused on the struggles of autistic people and how that struggle is shown by Bartleby. Being able to see this in another character not only helps the disabled person feel more understood, with the ability to relate, but it also helps others to understand some of the struggle. Fiction helps us to unraveled the world around us and putting words to concepts is critical to understanding. </p>

<h1>Bartleby the Autist: A Story of Burnout</h1>
<p class="start"><i>Originally created March 2023 for ENGL 287: American Literatures</i></p>
<p>Bartleby is a peculiar character, who&rsquo;s motives and thoughts are purposefully kept from our view. Instead, we&rsquo;re shown how he appears to others, specifically his boss who develops an unhealthy obsession with understanding the man. It becomes obvious that some of Bartleby&rsquo;s behavior can be explained by him having autism. Autism is a type of neurodivergence that effects every part of a person&rsquo;s life, often resulting in struggles with social situations, and struggles navigating a world that is so often setup against you. Autistic brains are often described as being wired completely differently than neurotypical brains. Therefore, Bartleby the Scrivener, by Herman Melville is a story about an autistic man suffering from serve burnout told through the lens of neurotypical narrator.</p>
<p>One of the most recognized signs of autistic is abnormal eye contact, which Bartleby displays. Several times throughout the book the author specifically notes that Bartleby is not facing the boss while speaking. During, what was intended to be a casual conversation, the boss notes that &ldquo;he did not look at me while I spoke&rdquo; (Melville 13), instead focusing on something in the background. This statement is not attributed to any other characters. The added detail that the object Bartleby was looking at was &ldquo;above my head [the bosses]&rdquo; (13) only adds more credibly to his struggle with eye contact. A common bit of advice for autistics is to focus on the forehead of a person, which can mimic eye contact. Bartleby does this to the best of his ability, by focusing on the statue instead, which also forces his body to face the boss, further mimicking expected social norms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bartleby is also shown struggling with theory of mind, the concept that other people aren&rsquo;t thinking or seeing the same things you are; That our internal world is entirely private. Theory of mind can be more difficult to autistic people, especially given that our minds work so differently than other people&rsquo;s. It can be hard to imagine something so foreign. One key moment with this is when the boss asks him why he has stopped working. &ldquo;&rsquo;Do you not see the reason for yourself,&rsquo; he indifferently replied&rdquo; (14). It&rsquo;s clear to see that Bartleby thinks that the reason is just as clear to everyone else as it is to him. By stating that his tone is indifferent cements this, Bartleby brushes it off like a stupid question, because in his mind it is. He&rsquo;s not realizing that the boss has no idea what he&rsquo;s thinking or feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Bartleby is working, he is fully dedicated to his task, and at several points refuses to switch focus. This is a common difficulty for autistic people, especially when they&rsquo;re deeply focused on the current project. His resistance to changing focus causes problems several times throughout the story. The first time Bartleby defies orders is after the boss &ldquo;abruptly called to&rdquo; (6) him, expecting &ldquo;instant compliance&rdquo; (6) in switching tasks. Instant and abrupt are used to really drive home the speed of the request. He&rsquo;s expected to, at the drop of the hat, to change what he&rsquo;s doing and do something entirely unexpected. There was no warning, no preparation, nor time to transition from one activity to the next. It&rsquo;s a difficult ask for anyone, but it&rsquo;s especially difficult for autistic people who have been so hyper focused on their previous task. Stopping suddenly can also make it far more difficult to resume the previous task, explaining why Bartleby choses to advocate for himself by saying no.</p>
<p>The wording and tone of Bartleby&rsquo;s rejection itself points towards autism. Autism can lead to more formal ways of speaking, with words used in a very exact manner to get the point across. If you&rsquo;re regularly misunderstood because of abnormal body language, you&rsquo;ll want to overcompensate with your words. &ldquo;&rsquo;I would prefer not to&rsquo;&rdquo; (6) is a fantastic example of this. This phrase itself is a bit odd, not something that you would normally hear, in fact the boss is entirely stunned by this. Being in charge he&rsquo;s no doubt heard no before, but the phrasing catches him off guard. Bartleby specifically choses the word prefer. He knows that he has the ability to do this task, but that he simply doesn&rsquo;t want to, so therefore uses prefer. It&rsquo;s his preference not to change tasks so quickly.</p>
<p>Autistic people are often characterized as emotionless, given that many don&rsquo;t express emotion in typical ways, very similar to the many descriptions of Bartleby. Throughout the story he&rsquo;s described in this way, in fact he&rsquo;s never ascribed any emotion, a stark contrast to every other character who do emote. After rejecting the bosses order &ldquo;His face was leanly composed, his gray eye dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him&rdquo; (7). Saying no to your boss is no doubt terrifying, especially at a new job, this is enough to cause some emotion, but Bartleby doesn&rsquo;t show this emotion. The same calm is repeated in all situations, even in ones which Bartleby seems upset or unnerved, he keeps the same blank expression. The boss soon becomes uncomfortable by this, comparing him to a specter, a sadly common reaction to autistic people like Bartleby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other people are overwhelming and distracting, especially for autistic people. Bartleby is given a quiet secluded corner of the room, his own bit of space, and is shown to be deeply uncomfortable when others invade the space. During a confrontation about his attitude, we see this line &ldquo;&rsquo;I would prefer to be left alone here,&rsquo; said Bartleby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy&rdquo; (14). The narrator shows confusion at Bartleby disliking people in his space, hence why the words &lsquo;as if&rsquo; were used. It serves to make the idea seem silly. However, for an autistic person not wanting anyone in your private space, no matter what&rsquo;s happening, is the most logical thing in the world. Mobbed is also a smart work to use, it brings about a very manic, hectic, and overwhelming experience, which simple scenarios can definitely feel like. What feels like a normal conversation, may feel like a riot to an autistic person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Routines are a very special thing to autistic people, especially self-imposed routines, which we see Bartleby rigidly follow through the course of the story, even to his own detriment. Having to change a routine for autistic people, especially without warning, can be very distressing. Bartleby&rsquo;s distress at changing routine&rsquo;s is shown several times, especially when the boss asks him to do sudden work. This distress is best snapshotted when Bartleby is fired from his job and is asked to leave the building. He can&rsquo;t bring himself to do either of those things, in fact, he tells the boss that he &ldquo;would prefer not to make any change at all&rdquo; (21). Most people dislike change, but the hatred is especially severe for Bartleby. He&rsquo;s given many other jobs he could do, but he repeatably states that he wants to keep scribing, despite his hatred for the work. He needs to keep his routine. This is also seen in his trespassing, he&rsquo;s used to waking up in the same house, going to the same spot and working, and this is forcibly being taken away from him. Given that he&rsquo;s already burnout, he can&rsquo;t cope with this change, and instead is static.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the story its clear to see that we aren&rsquo;t seeing Bartleby at his best, or even at his most functional. From the afterword we learn that Bartleby had previously worked at a dead letter office and was suddenly fired due to change in management. This leads me to believe that, combined with all the changes and stressors of a completely new job, Bartleby is suffering with extreme autistic burnout. This type of burnout differs slightly from neurotypical burnout in that in can be totally deliberating in every part of life. Towards the end of the story Bartleby tells the boss &ldquo;&rsquo;I prefer not to dine to-day&hellip; I am unused to dinners&rsquo;&rdquo;(23). By stating that he is not used to dinners, it implies that he hasn&rsquo;t had a proper dinner in a long time, and had truly been living off ginger nuts. Taking care of yourself can easily become near impossible with autistic burnout, explaining why he hasn&rsquo;t been eating to the point where he could starve to death. Most people would&rsquo;ve eaten, after all Bartleby was provided with food, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He was too fatigued to even eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see more signs of burnout when Bartleby stops working, and instead stands at the window, motionless. He has lost the ability to make four copies like he did just a few weeks prior, and is not unable to do anything. The boss describes him as standing in &ldquo;dead-wall revery&rdquo; (14). The word dead here is not only referring to the fact that the wall is motionless, but the status of his very soul. Bartleby is not staring deep in peaceful imagination, but instead is staring with dead eyes. He has lost all ability to do anything, to change, to emote, to eat, so utterly burned out that all he can do is stand and stare. Everything else is too exhausting for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the autistic traits that have been highlighted were slightly stereotypical and general, often traits which I can heavily relate to. Autistic presentation varies a lot from person to person, and even differs at different stages of a person&rsquo;s life. However, the combination of these traits and others I didn&rsquo;t have time to touch on make me confident in saying that Bartleby is autistic and suffering from burnout. This representation in part helps to normalize not being normal. Melville doesn&rsquo;t pick sides during the story, he never demonizes Bartleby, calls him lazy or looks down upon him. The character&rsquo;s which do look down on him aren&rsquo;t seen in a positive light. By showing the audience an autistic man struggling so much it helps to foster empathy and understanding, even when you&rsquo;re unable to know what&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes.</p>
