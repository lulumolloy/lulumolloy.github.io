    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p> This poster was crafted with a busy, distracted audience in mind, and an audience from the computer science world. As such the text was as concise as possible, highlighting the key points learned via the project. We were also able to keep some terminology unexplained (like GitHub) because we knew our target audience would understand it. </p>
    <p>This was a group project with one other person (duos). We had to split up tasks while ensuring that we weren&rsquo;t wasting time by doing the same tasks. Because the project is so intertwined we had to work closely together to make sure everything came out cohesively, and worked as intended. Our task was to answer a research question by analyzing a giant set of data using code, and showing our results. We not only had to create the poster, but we also had to work together to create a presentation showing how our code worked and some of the work behind everything.</p>
