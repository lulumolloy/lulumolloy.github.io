<h1>Context</h1>
<p> In this essay I examined the structure of a work, the language used, and the choices made for punctuation in order to understand the work. This sort of look into a poem facilitates very close analysis, thinking about how every comma is carefully placed for the authors intention. Word usage is especially highlighted. Given the mass amount of words in English, which words we chose and the connotations behind those words can speak volumes.</p>

<h1>Subverting Childhood</h1>
<p class="start"><i>Originally created February 2023 for ENGL 289: English Literatures From 18th Century</i></p>
<p>The dawn of the industrial revolution saw children leaving the pastures, and the joys of childhood to work in factories. This quickly became a staple, with young workers becoming increasingly common, after all their tiny bodies could get into tight spaces adults could not. Although many opposed child labor, the people with power, the ones who could change it, did not know, and did not care to know, how these children were being exploited. Elizabeth Barret Browning who wrote &ldquo;The Cry of the Children&rdquo; in protest of this. As such the meaning behind the poem is very clear to see, that this practice is horrific and needs to stop. However how she chooses to argue is interesting. Browning uses subversion to frame what&rsquo;s happening to these children as normal, showing how their lives have become completely contrary to what children&rsquo;s lives are supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browning writes this poem in a way where it sounds very lyrical and childlike, in sharp contrast to the dark subject matter. One of the key ways she gets across this tone is via an ABAB rhyme scheme. This is a basic scheme, most likely one of the first that a person will learn and with people able to notice it quickly. Her word choice of the rhymes is also simple, &ldquo;brothers&hellip;mothers&rdquo; and &ldquo;years&hellip;tears&rdquo; (1-4), are some of the first we see. By using simple words it is not only very accessible to the audience, but also reminds the audience of children&rsquo;s poems. At times it sounds like a nursery rhyme. However, throughout the poem she is speaking of the horrific treatment these children are living under, how they are being quickly destroyed by the work. This clash between subject and tone helps to make the audience uncomfortable, bringing to light that these serious topics are not being treated seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key aspect used to really emphasis her points is the use of punctuation, not only adding flow, but giving the audience moments where they need to stop and digest. Exclamation points are used often, as well as em-dashes. Browning uses both very effectively in these lines: &ldquo;Ay! be silent! Let them hear each other breathing / For a moment, mouth to mouth &mdash;&rdquo; (89-90). The two exclamation marks here serve to not only break up the sentences but add extra emotion to the call of the children, turning it into a desperate scream. It also adds to the idea that they are having to yell over the noise of the machinery and the noise of the other weeping children. Then after the screams, we are given a long em-dash, having the audience take a deep breath before continuing on. This also allows for the audience to metaphorically listen to the breathes of the children. These scheduled pauses really allow the audience to digest what they just heard for a few extra moments, really giving it a hard hit, then if it was just the usual short pause after a line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of strong punctuation Browning also made most of the stanza&rsquo;s end in an impactful moment, often one which changes the feeling of what came before, serving to further shock the audience. One instance of this, is when the speaker is urging &ldquo;Go out, children, from the mine&rdquo; (57). It is a call to action, that should convince children, after all what kind of children don&rsquo;t want to go play? The use of commas, separating the word children also reminds the audience that these are children, forcing them to momentarily pause of this fact. Their age makes it all the more disturbing when we are given this answer; &ldquo;Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows, / From your pleasures fair and fine!&rdquo; (63-64). The tight wording leaves no room for error, these children have no interest leaving, they prefer the quiet and dark of the mines. They are rejecting the pleasures of life. By having a setup where it seems like the children would leave, that they have every reason to leave, it makes this shift all the more surprising, allowing it to hit so much harder.</p>
<p>Before the industrial revolution had really kicked off, Romanticism was incredibly popular, teaching the generation before Browning what the ideal childhood looked like. Childhood was glorified, a time of innocence and play, where kids were meant to go out and be free among nature. No doubt Browning&rsquo;s parents were given these ideals, as well as many of the older people who oversaw changing policies. This childhood ideal is critical for this piece, allowing Browning to really highlight how these kids are not being given any childhood. She also cements the ideal by speaking of animals, how &ldquo;The young fawns are playing&rdquo; (7). Playing in nature is natural, it is the way the world is supposed to work; however reality is far from this ideal. Being able to work off her audience&rsquo;s preconceived notions of the world allows her, with few words setting up the ideal, to subvert their expectations with the harrowing truth.</p>
<p>One idea repeated throughout this poem is the realization that these children aren&rsquo;t seeing the outside world at all. They&rsquo;re stuck in metal factories, without birdsong or life, just endless mechanical droning. The speaker goes as far to say, &ldquo;They have never seen the sunshine&rdquo; (139). This idea is repulsive, completely contrary to the very idea of romanticism and should rightly chill anyone to their bones. Nature is a core part of life, for both children and adults. It&rsquo;s a place to reflect and become closer to the earth, and God. It seems like a simple part of life, one which is expected, but it has been stripped away from these children, who cannot even see the sun from their metal prisons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another innate part of being human (at least in the Victorian sense) that was stripped of these children is a connection to God. They aren&rsquo;t recognizing God, instead the machines seem to be the only persistence force in their lives. They say, &ldquo;And sometimes we could pray, / &lsquo;O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning) / &lsquo;Stop! be silent for to-day!&rsquo;&rdquo; (86-88). They aren&rsquo;t calling to God, or even human authorities but the wheels of the machinery themselves, who are endlessly driving them to work more and more. Their God, their reason for being alive, is these factory wheels. If they want something they think it best to pray to the factory. These conditions have skewed their entire world view of these children so much so that they don&rsquo;t believe in God, which would&rsquo;ve been a horrifying realization for the very religious population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even their youth is being stolen from these kids, with the harsh conditions resulting in premature again. Young and old are supposed to be opposites, however these children are skipping childhood as well as adulthood and going straight into elderhood. One of the best lines for this reads, &ldquo;&lsquo;Our young feet,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;are very weak!&rsquo;/ Few paces have we taken, yet are weary&mdash;&rdquo; (30-31). By using this metaphor of feet, we see that the children haven&rsquo;t gone very far, yet they are exhausted, they can&rsquo;t go on any longer. Normally it would take decades for feet to hurt this much. It really drives home the point that everything happening here is against nature, this is wrong and should&rsquo;ve never happened. Kids should have youthful energy but even the core aspect of what they are, young, has been taken by the factories.</p>
<p>A chilling aspect of this poem is casual way that accidental deaths are treated by the underage workers. Death has become a normal part of their lives. When confronted by this fact they tell us &ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; say the children, &lsquo;it may happen / That we die before our time!&rsquo;&rdquo; (37-38). This is the way that someone would shrug off any normal part of life, getting stuck in traffic, stubbing their toes, but instead they&rsquo;re shrugging off death. It isn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary, they specifically say it may happen. There&rsquo;s no worry or fear in that language. To make it worse the use of an exclamation point at the end invokes a kind of excitement and joy these children have towards dying early. They not only see death at a young age as normal but expected and even exciting. Of all people children are meant to be the furthest away from death, in many cases nowadays adults will even attempt to shield children from death, but these kids are being faced with it every day, as a force that will be coming sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This excitement towards dying early continues throughout the piece, emphasizing that death would be better than their current lives. After one of their coworkers dies, the children say this &ldquo;We looked into the pit prepared to take her &mdash; / Was no room for any work in the close clay: / From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,&rdquo; (41-43). They see a child being put into a grave and are jealous. Not because they believe she&rsquo;ll be going to Heaven, but because there&rsquo;s no room for work in the tiny space, she&rsquo;s in a grave yes, but she won&rsquo;t have to work anymore. This dead child can just sleep, not being woken up day after day to toil away in a mine. The children truly want death. This entire concept is harrowing, death is supposed to be frightening, something that only happens to adults, but instead we see kids excited for it because their lives are so terrible that death is good in comparison. Death is their only escape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the reason the children wish for death is that they don&rsquo;t know any life outside of the factories, this is all they ever had, everything else is foreign to them. The speaker asks the children to go outside, frolic in the meadows, &ldquo;But they answer, &lsquo;Are your cowslips of the meadows / Like our weeds anear the mine?&rsquo;&rdquo; (61-62). Children playing is natural, but these kids aren&rsquo;t even sure what the speaker is talking about. They do not know what flowering cowslips are, they ask if they are similar to the weeds near their mine. The weeds are the most nature they have ever been exposed to. There is a huge disconnect from nature among these children, a disconnect that is completely opposed to everything that the childhood ideal strives for these kids to have.</p>
<p>Browning throughout &ldquo;The Cry of the Children&rdquo; uses all these cases of subversion to really hammer in her point that children should not be working these factory jobs, it&rsquo;s against everything that children should be. The reader is left feeling as though the entire world has been flipped upside down. The children are wishing for death, romanticizing it even. They are turning old before their time. Nothing here is normal or correct. These kids have been deprived of everything children should have and are instead being worked to death. The musical, childlike tone especially helps to serve this message, it is portraying these dark issues like a normal thing, and unless the audience rises up to change the policies, it will continue to be the norm.&nbsp;</p>
