<h1>Context</h1>
<p>This essay compares three different works of art written as a political protest to see the similar yet differing methods used to articulate their points. The works used were &ldquo;Cry of the Children&rdquo; by Elizabeth Barret Browning (1843), &ldquo;They&rdquo; by Siegfried Sassoon (1917) and &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; by Green Day (2016). All three are relatively short requiring a very focused lens to adequately understand all meanings. It was important in this analysis to consider the cultural and historical contexts around these pieces, as these aspects had a large effect on the messaging. The political and cultural climate in each time period was especially critical to consider.</p>

<h1>Art as a Form of Protest</h1>
<p class="start"><i>Originally created April 2023 for ENGL 289: English Literature From 18th Century</i></p>
<p>We have three different pieces from very different times in history. &ldquo;Cry of the Children&rdquo; by Elizabeth Barret Browning, &ldquo;They&rdquo; by Siegfried Sassoon and &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; by the band Green Day. The pieces were published in 1843, 1917 and 2016 respectively. They were decades apart however they all exemplify a universal feeling. All of these pieces were created in reaction to an injustice occurring, with the intent to bring it to light and make a change. Art as a method to enact change is not a new phenomenon, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. Art can get across emotion and large ideas in more digestible, understandable ways. Certain techniques have survived through the decades. By looking at this selection of pieces created as a form of protest we can understand the methods that created successful art through the ages, and why those techniques were so effective.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Barret Browning&rsquo;s piece &ldquo;Cry of the Children,&rdquo; is a fantastic example of protest art that was able to create change in the real world. The poem was written after a scalding report shown light on the injustices occurring in the factories, many of which were being inflicted on children. It outlined the exploitation as well as the horrifying conditions. Her goal was to bring wide attention to the tragedy, and according to the British Library the piece has &ldquo;been credited as rousing greater public support for reforms surrounding child labour.&rdquo; Some of her techniques follow through our other pieces, laying the ground for future art to effectively get their message across to enact change, making it an important piece to look at as a basis.</p>
<p>Green Day&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; was written to protest the epidemic of mass shootings that have occurred in recent years, highlighting the indifference the general public has started to feel. The song starts off with exposition explaining that on the TV we see a another &ldquo;hostage executed/ by the terrorist group&rdquo; (Green Day 6-7). Our first assumption is that terrorist group is from the Middle East, especially given the &lsquo;War on Terror&rsquo; America has waged since 2001. This can also lead us to believe that this is being used to explain why the shooter did this; They were impacted by the violence seen on TV. However, the statement is very vague, not specifying who the terrorists are, or even who the hostages are. This allows the song to subvert our expectations, when, after focusing on the shooter, we realize that the exposition might be framing the shooter as the terrorist. An all-American terrorist.</p>
<p>Onomatopoeia is used early on to quickly and effectively remind the audience of all the mass shootings we&rsquo;ve seen through the years and remind of the horror that we should be feeling. In the chorus the words &ldquo;Bang! Bang!&rdquo; (Green Day 13) are shouted. This will no doubt evoke the sound of gunshots, which have bean heard many times on television and perhaps real life. There&rsquo;s a reason that the media will sometimes play the audio from tragedies; It's because it&rsquo;s especially chilling and scary, making the situation seem far more real. The violence is forced into our minds by hearing the noise that the gun makes. Not many other things will make the same distinct noise that gunshots do. It can also evoke other sounds heard during tragedies like screams. The band is able to bring across all these thoughts and feelings with just two words, making it incredibly effective at quickly conveying information.</p>
<p>Sassoon in &ldquo;They&rdquo; is protesting the apathy of those left home during World War One, and similar to Green Day, forces the audience to confront the horror via strong imagery, this time of the after effects of war. To do this he uses very concrete examples of harm done to the soldiers, going as far as to give them names to personalize them. During their reply to the priest the soldiers say that &ldquo;George lost both his legs; and Bill's stone blind&rdquo; (Sassoon 8). Both disabilities are simple to imagine, putting a clear picture in the audience&rsquo;s head in moments. They&rsquo;re also physical disabilities which cannot be ignored, they impact lives far too much to do so, and certainly cannot be hidden. It&rsquo;s also striking that before the war being injured in a way that cause blindness or the loss of limbs wasn&rsquo;t especially common, but that has changed. Sassoon uses popular names to accentuate how these injuries can happen to anyone and are happening to many people. It can also make the audience picture a specific person they know with that name, imagining how it would feel to have that person so badly affected. This all puts the tragedy on display right before us in a way that we can&rsquo;t ignore.</p>
<p>Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cry of the Children&rdquo; also capitalizes on clear visual impacts now being applied in mass, specifically the deathly look that children are starting to have. They&rsquo;re described many times throughout the poem, often highlighting how unnatural it is to see kids this pallid. At one point it&rsquo;s said that &ldquo;They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,/ And their look is dread to see&rdquo; (Browning 149-150). By using the words pale and sunken the mind automatically goes to very elderly people or corpses. This is not a natural state of children, especially given that children often have a bit of baby fat in their cheeks. Instead, they&rsquo;re deprived of this. The second line is worded in a way in which it&rsquo;s unclear whether their appearance is dreadful, or if they children have dread in their eyes. It could also be both. The vagueness will cause the audience to pause for a moment, and while thinking this really digest the image of these poor children so effected by the harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; is bringing our attention to the hypocrisy of those in power, to highlight their willful ignorance of the issue, and unwillingness to change it. The Vietnam war was one of the more controversial wars in American history with a good portion of the public against the war. It was also a war which we lost. The shooter relates his crime to the war before stating &ldquo;I love a lie just like anybody else&rdquo; (Green Day 24). By framing these two things together the audience is reminded of the propaganda and lies that were told for that war to happen. Some of those lies are still being told to pretend that the war was not a failure and a waste of lives. An important note is that Green Day doesn&rsquo;t say everybody, instead using the phrase &ldquo;anybody.&rdquo; This means that they&rsquo;re speaking of specific people and given the previous reference to the Vietnam War our minds are drawn to politicians and other people in power.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy and unwillingness to help is also highlighted in &ldquo;They&rdquo; when we&rsquo;re shown the reaction of the priest after being confronted with all the effects of the war. He, instead of trying to help, sticks blindly to his propaganda and tells the soldiers that &ldquo;The ways of God are strange!&rdquo; (Sassoon 12). This not only bushes away the feelings of the men but serves to further drive in the propaganda of this being a holy war, by making the men believe that God wants this. The statement also takes all responsibility away from the Priest, this is up to God, not to him. Of course, this is not the truth, in the poem the Priest is acting as the authority figure, a stand in for the religious monarchy at the time. He could do something and even acts as though he might help, but instead brushes the troubles aside and does nothing.</p>
<p>Browning is scalding when highlighting hypocrisy, pairing the British ideal with what was actually happening to the children, dismantling the ideal. Britain was often attributed as being a free land, where people can decide for themselves what their lives will be like, individualism was especially popular during this. However, these children aren&rsquo;t getting any of that freedom, nor were they given the childhood ideal. Instead &ldquo;They are weeping in the playtime of the others, In the country of the free&rdquo; (Browning 11-12). Romantics revered childhood innocence, and held all aspects of childhood sacred, but that idea was being destroyed by reality. Instead of playing, the children are working their lives away, deprived of everything society said they should have. This juxtaposition of the reality versus the ideal really help to cement how unnatural the current times were.</p>
<p>Dismantling the logic behind committing terrible acts proves to be a very powerful tool in convincing the audience to act, it can also point out flaws in the thinking process. In &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; the shooter does have some logic behind his actions. He sees himself as a warrior on a crusade to make the world better, he claims &ldquo;I've got my Vietnam&rdquo; (Green Day 23), very clearly likening his cause to fighting a war. However, by using Vietnam as the war it&rsquo;s much easier for the audience to immediately recognize that this logic is incredibly faulty. That war was unsuccessful, and didn&rsquo;t serve much good in the world, just sacrificing innocent lives, just like the shooter does during his massacre.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the war in &ldquo;They&rdquo; is slightly more nuanced, with the war being fought compared directly to holy wars against demons. The war was not actually fighting demons, they were people, but by calling them demons it gives a simple reasoning, making the war seem like &ldquo;a just cause&rdquo; (Sassoon 3). The word just doesn&rsquo;t only mean righteous, but it also implies that there&rsquo;s no other choice, the war must happen. But this propaganda is not considering the downsides of the war, nor does it give actual reasons to why the men are fighting. This hiding of the truth may be used because the war isn&rsquo;t worth it the loss, and the authority figures have to trick the public for their own gain.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Cry of the Children&rdquo; the exploitation of children is being done in order to progress society for &lsquo;the better.&rsquo; Browning says the establishment are using the labor &ldquo;to move the world, on a child's heart&rdquo; (Browning 154). By move the world she means to go forward with innovation and progression, most likely progression of the industrial revolution and continuing the &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; of the British Empire. This trend of excusing or justifying the suffering and harm of others is seen throughout all of these pieces, and all of them fail to give concrete reasons that the suffering is worth it. This vagueness makes the audience reflect on what human life is worth, is it worth sacrificing for the better of the world?</p>
<p>The shooter in &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; is not framed as an adult, instead he&rsquo;s framed as a child who&rsquo;s been perverted by the world. After the tragedy we&rsquo;re shown the reaction from the parents, with his mom being especially important. He&rsquo;s framed as &ldquo;Mommy&rsquo;s little/ solider&rdquo; (Green Day 18-19). There&rsquo;s no seriousness or understanding of the weight that&rsquo;s brought to being a solider, of the importance of the lives lost. Instead, he&rsquo;s a child with an ideal in his head. The word Mommy also implies this childlike view with the childish wording. Green Day could&rsquo;ve said mother, or mom, but chose Mommy intentionally. Little also signals to his age, and even works downplay the violence that might be seen in the news. We are clearly being shown a child that&rsquo;s being used by the outside world to fuel their agendas with no idea he&rsquo;s a pawn.</p>
<p>In Sassoon&rsquo;s work the soldiers are also depicted as children being used to further the war brought on by the authority figures. During the conversation the soldiers are referred to as &ldquo;boys&rdquo; (Sassoon 1) at several points. We generally don&rsquo;t call grown men boys unless we intend to belittle them. Even if the soldiers aren&rsquo;t actual kids, they&rsquo;re being looked at and treated like children. By doing this it reminds the audience that in most cases the people fighting for our freedom are just children who may not even understand the cause they&rsquo;re fighting for. This is an ongoing theme in these protest pieces of children being used and exploited, leading to tragedy.</p>
<p>Overall, these techniques can be seen throughout the decades, repeated in a variety of artworks created with the intent to make a change in the world. These tactics have been proven by the test of time, no doubt because they are successful in making people empathize with the cause and understand why change needs to happen. By knowing these strategies, especially the strategies which carried on from &ldquo;Cry of the Children&rdquo; which did enact change, we can learn effective ways to protest via art. With an ever-changing world that can seem forever corrupt having tools to fight back and make a difference is very important. This art can also pose as a way to release the tension inside from having to deal with all these terrible things.</p>
