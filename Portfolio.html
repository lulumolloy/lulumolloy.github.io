        <a href="#conclude">Concluding Thoughts</a></p>
    
        <p class="start">English. It&rsquo;s a field of study that&rsquo;s often undervalued and underappreciated. It isn&rsquo;t just about reading books and writing essays about why the curtains were blue (although we read a lot!). At its core, English is about communication and connection, often through written material. We read to see different perspectives, connect with people we may never meet, and learn about new ways of thinking. We write to share our thoughts and perspectives; We reach out into the world.</p>
    <p>My thoughts haven&rsquo;t always been like this; I shared the misconceptions and misgivings of the general populace when I first came here. Despite that, I chose English when I transferred to USCB. Why? Simple, I wanted to be a technical writer, and my research had shown that the best degree was either English or Communications. I hate being forced to speak, so English won by default. It became an annoying stepping stone to my true goals; I&rsquo;d get through it as quickly as I could, and move on without looking back. Similar to highschool in a way. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been as pleased as I am to be so utterly wrong about my assumptions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our program has six key learning outcomes for the degree. They exemplify what the professors hope to impart upon us, and the skills we should learn. In that vein, this portfolio displays my work and illustrates my growth in all six areas. This introduction serves to guide you through my journey to the current day.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo1">SLO 1: Reading Practices / Tools</h2>
    <p class="start">Before taking Dr. Barnes&rsquo;s Intro to English Studies, I didn&rsquo;t know what close reading actually meant. I assumed it was concluding the author was sad because the curtains were blue, that it was shallow baseless assumptions about things that didn&rsquo;t matter. We definitely get into minute details, but we use those details holistically. Going back to the curtain analogy, we&rsquo;d see that the author describes the curtains as blue, but what other set dressings are mentioned? Maybe the thick navy curtains block out the sunshine, plunging the protagonist's living room into darkness. Or maybe the baby blue chiffon curtains let the light pour into the nursery through its thin fabric. We can examine those sentences and use the details to extract the feeling the author is conveying. Minute details matter in that they were chosen for a reason (often subconscious reasons) that can inform us about the story.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Another key aspect of literary analysis is giving attention to the varied contexts around a work including the period in time, the culture, the geography, and the authorial biases. The majority of the works I&rsquo;ve studied were written before the 20th century, with most being from American or British authors. The &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; focus isn&rsquo;t ideal for a broad view, although my professors made sure to diversify as much as they could within the focus of the class. However, this view neglects the fact that &ldquo;the past is a foreign country&rdquo; as said by LP Hartley in his novel <i>The Go-Between</i>. We&rsquo;re not only getting a chance to look into our past but we're also learning how to understand a work that was created in an entirely different context to what we know. One of the things that has stuck with me the most is the similarity between people, no matter the context. People are people. We&rsquo;re empathetic, creative, and curious.</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo2">SLO 2: Rhetorical Awareness and Composition</h2>
    <p class="start">Audience is one of the most critical aspects of writing effective pieces, especially for my chosen field of technical writing. It&rsquo;s an often overlooked aspect, especially for academic writing. Despite that, audience always plays a role, even if it&rsquo;s subconscious. A key example is refraining from using casual or crass language in academic writing; On several occasions, I&rsquo;ve had to stop myself from using the word &lsquo;vibe&rsquo; in essays because it&rsquo;s currently slang. Being able to pinpoint exactly what I&rsquo;m doing has been incredibly helpful to all my classes and to life outside of education.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve taken our Professional Writing Workshop course twice now which firmly cemented the importance of audience. The beginning half of that course focuses on genre analysis, giving us the skills to approach an unknown genre and successfully implement it. Fitting into audience expectations, in a sense, is an act of creativity. You have to figure out how to best communicate. I was able to put this into practice during a computer science course I took, wherein we had to create a poster showing our research findings. This poster was aimed at an audience with a computer science background, so the expectations differed from what I was used to.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo3">SLO 3: Literary Interpretation</h2>
    <p class="start">Coming into college I wasn&rsquo;t very good at literary interpretation and didn&rsquo;t give it much credit. I&rsquo;ve always been a very literal person, I take what I see at face value and run with it. I&rsquo;ve had to learn to overcome that in social situations, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that issue extended to other aspects of life. I first started to understand this issue of mine during Intro to English Studies. A key moment was when we read <i>Passing</i> by Nella Larsen. During our class discussions, the topic of queer undertones was brought to the forefront and this amazed me. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it like that, but looking back they had a point. The class discussion opened my eyes to an entirely new interpretation. To this day class discussions have enriched my understanding of countless works, and have been invaluable. I would&rsquo;ve never guessed that was the case before that class, but it holds true. Applying what I&rsquo;d learned I started having my own insights into the works. This was especially the case in poetry, where I&rsquo;d struggled before (and still do to an extent).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One experience that has stuck with me in terms of interpretation (and close reading) was Dr. Barnes&rsquo;s American Novel class, wherein we spent the entire class focused on <i>Little Women</i> by Louisa May Allcot. At first, I was doubtful that any singular book could fill an entire semester, yet at the end of it, I still had more to say. We dug into a multitude of interpretations, stripping the book back to its bones and examining it for knowledge. In the class, we probably shared quite a few opinions, but we didn&rsquo;t all agree on a single interpretation. In fact, I hold several interpretations in my head, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same for my classmates. It provided an amazing opportunity to get far more in-depth than any other class has had the time to. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good format for all classes, but as a single semester experience, it was amazing to see how many thoughts came about from that single story.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo4">SLO 4: Applying Frameworks</h2>
    <p class="start">My artifact to showcase my use of theoretical and philosophical frameworks was written before coming to USCB; It was written in my second semester of college. Based on this, it can feel weird to say I&rsquo;ve gained this skill from USCB, but it&rsquo;s true. The paper illustrates that I&rsquo;ve cared and wanted to think critically about these things since the start, however, it wasn&rsquo;t until coming here that I was able to name and expound upon what I was doing. Before I would&rsquo;ve just said that the paper was just about my research, but it&rsquo;s more than that. It&rsquo;s my argument against bigotry and the systemization of it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The key theories I engage with are very personal to me; Critical disability theory, feminism, and queer theory namely. I&rsquo;ve also done research into critical race theory, as shown in my piece about IQ, but the latter is more of a focus (I lack the knowledge to do critical race theory justice). I started to tap into the issues of disability rights with my Bartleby essay, and looking back I would want to expound upon that using the new tools and thoughts I&rsquo;ve acquired. The systematized discrimination needs to be dismantled and this degree has given me tools to help fight against it.</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo5">SLO 5: Engaging Others's Perspectives</h2>
    <p class="start">As a kid I was a huge bookworm; The main reason for this was the escapism and joy at seeing lives I&rsquo;d never live. Most of the books I read back then were American and didn&rsquo;t give me much of a different perspective from my own, but it served to dip my toes into seeing other cultures. As I got older the lust for books fell away, but my drive to see differing perspectives didn&rsquo;t. I started getting interested in what life was like in the UK, and how it differed from my life. It helps that my best friend is Welsh. In the current day, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of translated comics and novels, mainly originating from South Korea, Japan, and China. It&rsquo;s given me insight into their cultures in ways I would&rsquo;ve never had without reading. For instance, I have rough currency conversion rates off the top of my head, and I know why those three cultures hate being confused with each other. All that to say in my personal life one of my favorite parts of books is being able to learn new things through osmosis, seeing rather than being taught.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the themes that has stuck with me throughout my career in English studies is the fact that humans are very similar. We have different cultures, languages, geography, etc, but on the inside we&rsquo;re similar. Knowing that made me all the more interested in the history of English as a language because its roots are so multicultural. Before America became a melting pot, our language was that pot. Germanic, French, Scandinavian, Latin, then branching out beyond Europe, incorporating words and thoughts from all over the globe. Even today the language continues to grow, we adopt new words, new ideas, and new concepts. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d have this understanding without my degree.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2 id="slo6">SLO 6: Project Design and Management</h2>
    <p class="start">I was never a fan of group projects as a kid, I&rsquo;d always end up doing all the work while my teammates coasted. As such, having to do group projects in college was daunting. During my first semester at USCB, I took a history course. To my surprise that group ran fairly smoothly with each person (bar one who ghosted) doing their fair share. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until my English major courses that I lost most of my distrust and became neutral towards the prospect. My biggest turning point was my first foray into Dr. Swoffords&rsquo;s Professional Writing Workshop wherein most of the course relied upon group work, partially to give us a taste of the real world. The reason I&rsquo;m even mentioning group work is that I believe it&rsquo;s a fundamental unspoken aspect of project management. Outside of academics, it&rsquo;s rare to be the sole person on a project. Learning how to cooperate and rely on others is a key step.</p>
    <p>Throughout my English education, I&rsquo;ve done numerous large projects, including this portfolio, and have learned so much. Funny enough a large part of my learning was down to the experience in doing so many projects, growing through experience. I look back at some of my first projects and my brain starts thinking of new ways to do things and changes I would make. The projects also served as chances for me to work on skills outside of the ones required for the course, i.e. my decision to learn HTML to make this website; It was in no way required, but I wanted to learn for my own enrichment (having a project makes it easier for me to learn). I had a similar experience when I learned to use InDesign for portfolio creation. If I want something a specific way I&rsquo;ll do everything in my power to do it. It's a bit of stubborn tenacity.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2 id="conclude">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="start">My education has been invaluable, far beyond a piece of paper stating I&rsquo;ve got a college education. It&rsquo;s left me with lessons that I&rsquo;ll carry with me for the rest of my life, and skills that I&rsquo;ll continue to hone for years to come. It helped make me into the person I am today. I won&rsquo;t stop growing, but I&rsquo;ll always be able to point to wide growth rings to see the impact USCB has had on me. (I&rsquo;m alluding to tree rings, ring width signifies how prosperous that time was, with larger rings being better.)</p>
